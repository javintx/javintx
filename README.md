<h1 align="center"> I'm Javier and I'm a.. </h1>
<h3 align="center"> Java Software Engineer | I practice TDD, SOLID, KISS, Hexagonal architecture | I love CI/CD | I'm learning Kotlin, Typescript, Python... </h3>


Current goals:
- Training my <b>Good Practices</b> skills
- Learning <b>Kotlin</b>, <b>Typescript</b>, <b>Python</b>...
- Get even better at <b>CI/CD</b>
- Improve my knowledge on hexagonal architecture


Some projects that I have completed in which I have practised a lot of things:
- [mower](https://github.com/javintx/mower) : Project with hexagonal architecture, using TDD and GitHub CI/CD and Docker for running.
- [the-crm-service](https://github.com/javintx/the-crm-service) : Project with hexagonal architecture, with SparkJava or SpringBoot for the REST API, with in-memory adapter for persistence, implemented using TDD and GitHub CI/CD, and Docker for running.

Some project under development where I try to test a lot of more things:
- [NILO](https://github.com/javintx/nilo) : Springboot application.
- [Companysa](https://github.com/javintx/companysa) : Another kata. Hexagonal approach by packages.
- [mower-kt](https://github.com/javintx/mower-kt) : The same mower project, but in Kotlin. <-- To improve: This is one of my first contacts to Kotlin.
- [AdventOfCode](https://github.com/javintx/AdventOfCode) : The Advent Of Code implementations.
- [AdventOfKotlinCode](https://github.com/javintx/AdventOfKotlinCode) : The Advent Of Code implementations, but in Kotlin. <-- To improve: This is another of my first contacts with Kotlin.
